Code test for Crosskey internship

to run run the app:

- git clone the code to local machine
- cd to the downloaded folder
- execute command: mvn package
- execute command: java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App

I tried handling some sample edge-cases, however this quickly resulted in code becoming messy and probably not what the task was intended for, but I left in what I had already made.
